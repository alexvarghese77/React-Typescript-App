 to get started with TypeScript and React, this is all you need to do:

    > npm install -g create-react-app

    > create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
    
    > cd my-app/
    
    > npm start
Now you have a working React/TypeScript web site. And the build process is taken care of:

    # start the server on port 4000, with hot-reloading enabled
    > npm start

    # run jest tests continuously
    > npm test

    # package a build for deployment
    > npm run build

    # heck, generate the test coverage report
    > npm test -- --coverage
